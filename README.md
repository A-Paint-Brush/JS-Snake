# JS Snake

This is a simple framerate-dependent snake game that I made to practice my Javascript skills. I made this game over a year ago, so there are several places in the code that I don't like the look of (such as the hard-coded values and magic numbers), but it would be a lot of work to refactor it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Installation

All resources are client-side, so simply download this repository and open `Snake.html` in a browser.

## How to Play

Instructions are on the page.

## Credits

I drew the page favicon, while sound effects are from the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) asset library.
